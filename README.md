# no-push-main
This repo has a script to enforce a pre-push hook, it prevents developers from pushing changes directly to the main branch. this ensures that all changes are pushed to a separate branch and reviewed before being merged into the main branch, improving the main branch's integrity. Installation &amp; configuration instructions are available in the README.
